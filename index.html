      <h1>Welcome to My Learning Page</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Shubham Kumar</strong>, a Web Development Intern</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a passionate and driven tech enthusiast currently exploring the world of web development. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity — how do websites work? That curiosity quickly turned into a deep interest in understanding how technology powers our digital world.

            As part of my growth, I’ve started learning and working with the core pillars of web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies have allowed me to build dynamic and engaging webpages from scratch, and every new concept I learn opens up more possibilities to express creativity through code.
            
            Currently, I’m doing a hands-on web development internship where I apply these skills to real-world tasks, learning the best practices for clean code, responsive design, and interactive elements. I enjoy experimenting with new layouts, styles, and JavaScript logic to make websites not just functional, but also enjoyable to use.
            
            Beyond coding, I have a genuine interest in user experience and visual design. I believe a good website doesn’t just work well — it should also feel intuitive and look appealing. This mindset motivates me to continually improve my skills in front-end technologies and eventually explore backend tools and full-stack development.
            
            I also value self-growth, teamwork, and continuous learning. Whether it's debugging an issue, trying out a new framework, or reading about tech trends, I’m always eager to challenge myself and expand my knowledge.
            
            My ultimate goal is to become a skilled developer who builds solutions that help people, solve problems, and bring ideas to life on the web. I'm excited about the path ahead — and this is just the beginning.</p>

      <h2>What is Html, Css and JavaScript...??</h2>
      <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
            It organizes content like titles, text, images, and buttons in a structured format. Every element in HTML is wrapped in tags to give it meaning and purpose.
            Think of HTML as the skeleton or structure of a webpage.</p>
            <p>DOCTYPE html – Declares the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps browsers render the page correctly.</p>

                <p>"html"– The root element that wraps all other HTML content on the page.</p>
                
                <p>"head" – Contains metadata like the page title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. It’s not visible to the user.</p>
                
                   <p>body – Holds all the content that is displayed on the webpage, like text, images, buttons, etc.</p>
                
                     <p>h1 to h6 – Represent headings.h1is the largest and most important, while h6 is the smallest.</p>
                
                       <p>p – Used to define a paragraph of text.</p>
                
                         <p>img src="..." alt="..." – Displays an image. The src attribute holds the image link, and alt provides a description if the image doesn’t load.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. While HTML provides the structure of a webpage and CSS is used for its design and layout, JavaScript allows the webpage to respond to user actions such as clicks, typing, scrolling, or form submissions. It can be used to change content on the page, show or hide elements, display messages, update data without refreshing the page, and much more.

        JavaScript runs directly in the web browser, making it possible to create real-time, interactive experiences for users. It works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance a website’s functionality and user engagement. For example, when you click a button and a popup appears or when a form warns you that a field is empty, that’s JavaScript in action.
        
        It is a lightweight and powerful language that supports complex features like animations, real-time updates, games, and communication with servers. JavaScript plays a major role in modern web development and is supported by all web browsers. Over time, it has also evolved to be used on the server-side through environments like Node.js, making it one of the most versatile and widely-used languages in the world of web development.</p>
